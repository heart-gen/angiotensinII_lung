# Cell type-specific expression of angiotensin receptors in the human lung

## Abstract
The renin-angiotensin system is a highly characterized integrative pathway in mammalian homeostasis whose clinical spectrum has been expanded to lung disorders such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)-emphysema, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and COVID pathogenesis. Despite this widespread interest, specific localization of this receptor family in the mammalian lung is limited, partially due to the imprecision of available antibody reagents. In this study, we establish the expression pattern of the two predominant angiotensin receptors in the human lung, *AGTR1* and *AGTR2*, using complementary and comprehensive bulk and single-cell RNA-sequence datasets that are publicly available. We show these two receptors have distinct localization patterns and developmental trajectories in the human lung, pericytes for *AGTR1* and a subtype of alveolar epithelial type 2 cells for *AGTR2*. In the context of disease, we further pinpoint *AGTR2* localization to the COPD-associated subpopulation of alveolar epithelial type 2 (AT2B) and *AGTR1* localization to fibroblasts, where their expression is upregulated in individuals with COPD, but not in individuals with IPF. Finally, we examine the genetic variation of the angiotensin receptors, finding *AGTR2* associated with lung phenotype (i.e., cystic fibrosis) via rs1403543. Together, our findings provide a critical foundation for delineating this pathwayâ€™s role in lung homeostasis and constructing rational approaches for targeting specific lung disorders.
