Support for the 'engine' argument is deprecated and will be removed after September 2025.
Kaleido will be the only supported engine at that time.


Disease-specific full clusters (>50% disease): ['5', '6']
NMI (core vs full on overlapping cells): 0.327
[WARN] Could not save PNG: 

Kaleido requires Google Chrome to be installed.

Either download and install Chrome yourself following Google's instructions for your operating system,
or install it from your terminal by running:

    $ plotly_get_chrome
